#I can certainly help you with coding an AI chatbot that can scrape your website's content and provide relevant answers. To build this, we can use Python with the help of various libraries such as BeautifulSoup for web scraping and NLTK for natural language processing. Here's an example of how you can get started:

#1. Install the required libraries:
#pip install beautifulsoup4
#pip install nltk

#2. Import the necessary libraries in your Python script:

from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('corpus')
nltk.download('wordnet')

#3. Scrape the content from your website:

def scrape_website(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')

    # Scrape relevant content from the website
    # Update the code based on the structure of your website
    title = soup.find('h1').text
    paragraphs = [p.text for p in soup.find_all('p')]

    return title, paragraphs


#4. Process the scraped content:

def preprocess_text(text):
    # Tokenize the text
    tokens = word_tokenize(text)

    # Remove stopwords
    stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
    tokens = [token for token in tokens if token.lower() not in stop_words]

    # Lemmatize words
    lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
    tokens = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(token) for token in tokens]

    return tokens


def find_answer(user_query, paragraphs):
    query_tokens = preprocess_text(user_query)
    match_scores = {}

    for para in paragraphs:
        para_tokens = preprocess_text(para)
        score = len(set(query_tokens).intersection(para_tokens))
        match_scores[para] = score

    # Sort paragraphs based on match scores
    sorted_paragraphs = sorted(match_scores, key=match_scores.get, reverse=True)

    # Return the most relevant answer
    return sorted_paragraphs[0]


# Scrape website content
website_url = 'https://www.myntra.com'  # Replace with your website URL
title, paragraphs = scrape_website(website_url)

print("Website content: ")
print("Title: ", title)
print("Paragraphs: ", paragraphs)

while True:
    user_query = input("Ask me a question: ")

    # Find the most relevant answer
    answer = find_answer(user_query, paragraphs)

    print("Answer: ", answer)
